                        <p>Cyber Disputes resolution is a tricky affair for all stakeholders including courts, government, companies, individuals, international organizations etc.This is more so where conflict of law is involved as different countries have different set of laws for dispute resolution. As a result international commercial disputes face many difficulties for their resolutions earlier. </p>
<p>
To reduce the hardships of such disputes, countries adopted a model code of conduct that was incorporated in their respective domestic laws. The advent of harmonized Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods like Arbitration and Mediation is a result of such international codification.</p>
<p>
For instance, UNCITRAL (the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) has adopted the UNCITRAL Conciliation Rules in 1980 and also adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration in 1985.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the United Nations has recommended the use of the said Model Law and Rules in cases where a dispute arises in reference to international commercial relations and the parties seek an amicable settlement of that dispute by recourse to conciliation.India has also incorporated these uniform principles of alternative dispute resolution in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by way of amendment in the year 2015. The Arbitration Act provides for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms like arbitration, conciliations etc for national and international stakeholders.</p>

<p> The Arbitration Act has not yet considered the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for dispute resolution in the manner as expected. For instance, online dispute resolution (ODR) is still missing from the Indian scenario despite the Arbitration Act.  </p>
<p>Our objective is to promote and use of ODR in India for various dispute resolution purposes. We can safely claim that ODR would see active use in the coming years in India. To help national and international ODR stakeholders they can use ODR clause in their agreements, contracts, etc. We also plan to launch a dedicated ODR Forum where techno legal aspects would be discussed. ODR experts and specialists wishing to associate with LegalSutra can also send their resume.  </p>

<p>For those stakeholders who are interested in use of ODR and cyber arbitration in India in the coming years, we are providing some insights and trends through this introduction. These are : </p>
<p>
(1) <b>Digital Disputes:</b> Indian governmentâ€™s focus upon digital projects like digital India, e-governance, etc would increase digital disputes in the year 2017. As on the date, neither the regulatory framework nor the online dispute resolution infrastructure is in place to tackle such high number of digital disputes. Indian government is working on these fronts, and till the end of 2017 we may see some positive developments on these fronts.</p>
<p>
(2) <b>Techno Legal Norms:</b> The years would see formulation of techno legal norms by Indian government, arbitral institutions and ODR institutions. Laws like Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act 2000), Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, etc would see further amendments in the years to come to accommodate online dispute resolution (ODR) and cyber arbitration in India. In short, a basic level legal framework would be put in place very recently for ODR and cyber arbitration.</p>

<p>(3) <b>PPP Based ODR Models:</b> Indian government is encouraging public private partnership (PPP) based ODR and cyber arbitration models. This is natural as Indian government is yet to brace ODR and cyber arbitration.</p>

<p>(4) <b>Consolidation of ODR Segment:</b> Consolidation of ODR and cyber arbitration industry would also take place very soon. A few cyber arbitration and dispute resolution players are working in India since the enactment of Information Technology Act, 2000 but actual working models are still missing. The startups and entrepreneurship trends of India 2017 have already predicted increased use of ODR and e-courts in India.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Consumer Protection in Cyberspace:</b> Consumer protection in cyberspace is one of the top priorities of Indian government. The focus is upon cyber arbitration and online dispute resolution of various consumer disputes. A time bound dispute resolution mechanism is being developed by Government. Even consumer courts/forums would be accessible through online means and aggrieved consumers can file their complaints from any part of India. Though this is not a full fledged one but would be consisting in the first stage of dispute resolution only.</p>

<p>(6) <b>E-Commerce Disputes:</b> We see a big growth in the use of ODR for resolution of e-commerce disputes in India. No smart e-commerce player would be interested in keeping public grievances and disputes pending and unresolved. Further, e-commerce companies could also not afford negative reviews that are generated due to unresolved consumer disputes. Cyber arbitration and ODR would be of tremendous help to such e-commerce players, dissatisfied customers, etc.</p>

<p>(7) <b>International Commercial Arbitration:</b> International commercial arbitration can be the biggest winner by using cyber arbitration and ODR in India. This is more so on the fields of cross border technology transactions and cross border e-commerce transactions. We have been working in this direction for the past few years and international e-commerce and technology companies can have a firsthand experience of the same with our experts. Interested national and international stakeholders can contact us in this regard and avail our cyber arbitration and ODR services.</p>
